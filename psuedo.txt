var remaining = 10;
var wordList = [an array of words]

Word
this.currentWord = (wordList[Math.floor(Math.random() * wordList.length)]);.
this.splitWord = currentWord.split(‘’);
(Split) the selected word into an [array of individual letters and spaces].

Letter
Constructor of letter objects.  Pass (letters) into it.  The will have the following properties:
{
this.lett = ‘’; 
this.guessed =  false;
this.hidden = ‘_ ’;
this.revealed = this.lett + ’ ’;
}

Get the array of individual letters and spaces.
Loop throug the array
For each item of the array, pass these into the Letter Constructor.  Create an [array of {Letter objects}].
If the item in the array is a space between words, then set the object property of guessed = true.

(Start)
(Display) the array of Letter objects onto the screen.  
If the guessed property = false, then display “_ “
If the guessed property = true, then display the let variable.

(Prompt) the user to ’Guess a letter!’ using inqurirer.

 
(Check) the answer agianst the array of letter objects.  
Loop through the array of letter objects.   
If the guess = the letter property of any of the letter objects, then 
set the guessed property of that object/those objects to = true
(Display) the array of Letter objects onto the screen.  
If the guessed property = false, then display this.hidden
If the guessed property = true, then display this.revealed
	Console.log(‘CORRECT!!!’) – in green font?
	(Prompt) the user to ’Guess a letter!’ using inqurirer

If the guess does not equal any of the letters, then 
reduce the number of guesses by 1.
If the number of guesses remaining = 0, then 
			Display “You lost. Next word!”
			(Start) over.
		Else 
		(Display) the array of Letter objects onto the screen.  
If the guessed property = false, then display “_ “
If the guessed property = true, then display the let variable.
			Console.log(‘INCORRECT!!!’) – in red font?
			Console.log(remaining + ‘ guesses remaining!!!’);
			(Prompt) the user to ’Guess a letter!’ using inqurirer
